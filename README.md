# Shout-Optimizer-Processing
Processing code for the Shout Optimizer school project.

## Overview of the project

Shout Optimizer was designed to solve an actual problem that our group was familiar with. When viewing items on online auctions, it can be hard to evaluate an optimal buying price for an item. How do you decide when to stop bidding on an item? On the other hand, it can also be hard to evaluate a proper selling price for an item you want to put up for auction, especially if the item youâ€™re trying to sell is not being sold at the time. Our system, the Shout Optimizer uses data from Huuto.net auction site, and evaluates a price for each item. The user can search for an item with keywords, and the system will provide the user with selling and buying price, as well as links to previous auctions of the item. The system currently works for PlayStation 2 games only. The project was created with Python and HTML.
